## EnderPearlPlus

Spigot plugin that aims to fix problem - [this](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-55823)
This bug causes ender pearls to "forget" their owner if the player exits and re-enters the game while the pearl is in mid-air. As a result, when the ender pearl eventually lands, it fails to teleport the player, breaking the expected gameplay mechanic.

I.e. this plugin helps ender pearls remember it's owner.

As a bonus it's adds ability to customize ender pearl behaviour such as allowing teleporting from other world
